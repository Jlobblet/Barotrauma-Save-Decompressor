writing [the code that made this possible](https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma/blob/master/Barotrauma/BarotraumaShared/SharedSource/Utils/SaveUtil.cs)

## Installation

Either build the project from source, or download a compressed executable from the latest release. The included `.dll`
files must be within the same directory as the executable.

## Usage

Run `Barotrauma-Save-Decompressor.exe`.

### Decompression

To decompress a file, click the Browse button in the decompression (top) section. Navigate to the file's location, and
select it. Then click Decompress. The resulting folder will be created in the same folder as the file selected, with the
same name as the file.

### Compression

To compress a folder, click the Browse button in the compression (bottom) section. Navigate to the location of the
folder to compress, and select it. Then click Compress. The compressed file will be in the parent directory of that
folder, with the same name and the file extension `.
